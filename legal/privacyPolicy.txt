Effective date: December 3rd, 2018.

Bliinx Inc. (â€œBliinxâ€, "us", "we", or "our") operates the www.bliinx.co public website (the â€œWebsiteâ€) and the Bliinx online contact management platform and mobile Online Service (the â€œOnline Serviceâ€), the access and use of which are reserved to authorized users (the Website and the Online Service being collectively referred to as the "Service").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, disclosure and any other processing of Personal Data (as defined below) when you use the Service and of the choices you have associated with the processing of that data. In addition to this policy, the agreement we execute with each Customer (as defined below) also contains provisions about our confidentiality obligations regarding data, including Personal Data and non-Personal Data. Consequently, Customers will also want to refer to the relevant contractual documentation for additional information on the subject.

We use your Personal Data to provide and improve the Service. By using the Service, you agree to the processing of information in accordance with this policy.

1. DEFINITIONS

An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

1.2. â€œUsage Dataâ€ is data collected automatically and either generated by the use of the Service or from the Service infrastructure itself.

1.3. â€œCookiesâ€ are small pieces of data stored on a Userâ€™s device. They contain small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a website and stored on your device.

1.4. â€œCustomerâ€ means a purchaser of Bliinx products and services.

1.5. â€œData Controllerâ€ is an expression frequently used in personal information protection laws to mean a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Data. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, we have two separate and distinct roles:

- We are a Data Controller only in respect of the Personal Data we collect from our Customers and from our Website visitors.

- When our Customers and the Users upload Personal Data to the Online Service for the purpose of relationship management of their business contacts, we are not the Data Controller but solely act as Data Processor of that information. In such a case, the Customer acts as the Data Controller and is responsible for compliance of its affiliated Users with applicable personal information protection laws. Through its Users acting as representatives, the Customer is responsible for complying with applicable personal information protection laws, which entails â€“ among others â€“ obtaining the consent of Data Subjects whose Personal Data is collected and processed, managing the consent-revoking process and enabling the right to access the Personal Data collected.

1.6. â€œData Processorâ€ (or â€œService Providersâ€) is an expression frequently used in personal information protection laws to mean a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes Personal Data on behalf of the Data Controller (other than its own employees).

We may use the services of various Service Providers in order to process your data more effectively, all in accordance with this policy. Please see Section 4.2 for more details about the types of Service Providers we use and how we manage such relationships with respect to the processing of your Personal Data.

When Customers and Users upload Personal Data in the Online Service for the purpose of relationship management of business contacts, we act solely as Data Processor to this information. We process the data on behalf of the Customer and in order to provide and improve the Service.

1.7. â€œData Subjectâ€ is an expression frequently used in personal information protection laws to any natural person who is the subject of Personal Data.

1.8. â€œUserâ€ is a natural person using our Service. A User may be a Customer or an employee of a Customer. Users also are Data Subjects when we act as Data Controller.

2. SOURCES OF PERSONAL DATA

We process the Personal Data that originates from your use of the Service, including the portions of the Service that are publicly accessible (such as the Website) and those that require the creation of an account to access (such as the Online Service).

We also process the Personal Data provided by our Customers and Users in the context of their use of the Online Service.

3. PURPOSES OF PROCESSING AND LEGAL BASIS

We process each of the following types of Personal Data for the purposes described below to provide and
improve the Service for our Customers and Website visitors.

3.1. Customer Information. When a Customer requests products or services from Bliinx, Bliinx may collect and process Personal Data or other information related to the Customer which the Customer chooses to provide. For example, when a Customer registers to receive content, completes forms on Bliinxâ€™s Website (including information reporting a problem with the Website or Online Service), or communicates with Bliinx, the Customer is willingly providing information which could be included the collection of Personal Data.

(a) Purposes and Legal Basis. We process our Customersâ€™ Personal Data to provide appropriate products and services to fit our Customersâ€™ needs. The legal basis to this processing is our Customersâ€™ consent. We process the Personal Data to verify the financial information and to collect payments to the extent that doing so is necessary to complete a transaction and perform our contract with our Customers.

The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in protecting the security of each Userâ€™s account and of the Online Service in general.

We also process the Usersâ€™ email address to recognise them when they use our customer support. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in providing the best customer support we may offer you.

7. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA TO OTHER COUNTRIES

We process your Personal Data on our Service Providerâ€™s systems in Canada. However, usage of certain features, such as image recognition, may involve that the specific data processed through such features, such as an image for example, be processed outside of Canada. Therefore, it is possible that your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to â€” and maintained on â€” computers located outside of your state, province, country or other jurisdiction, where the data protection laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.

9. ANALYTICS

We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.

Google Analytics. Our Website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service offered by Google which transmits website traffic data to Google servers in the United States. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. We use reports provided by Google Analytics to help us understand website traffic and web page usage.

You can opt-out of having made your activity on the Service available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity.

Concerning our application, there are four ways in which Google Analytics will analyse usersâ€™ activity using their data: (i) BigQuery allows us to analyse the entire dataset to predict future user behavior. (ii) Firebase Crash Reporting allows us to receive the frequency at which crashes arise and which Users are impacted the most. We can also target audiences which are impacted and release notifications to those. (iii) Firebase Cloud Messaging logs events which are released based on the application interactions such as clicking or pressing an interface component, like a button. (iv) Firebase Remote Config receives user behavior and data to categorise them in audiences, which then allows us to customise their experience by changing the appearance and behavior of the application.
